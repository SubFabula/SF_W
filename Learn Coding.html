	<h2>Time to Learn Programming!</h2>
	<p>We'll start with HTML then Lua and go on.</p>
	<p>Before that, if you want to learn Programming from another place, you can use <a href="https://mimo.org/">Mimo</a> which is an app for learning any Programming Language.</p>
	<p>Now! About the place that we are gonna use to Program.<br>So, first you need a Computer (idk any Mobile Apps for Programing), if you don't have a Programming App you can use <strong>NotePad</strong> or download <strong><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">NotePad++</a></strong> wich makes Programming easier.</p>
	<p>Let's learn Programming!</p>

		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<p>Let's first understand what's HTML is actualy used for.</p>
		<p>HTML is made for making Web Sites like this one but its not actualy a Programming Language, its a Mark Up Language or as its name <b>Hiper Text Mark Up Language</b> wich if you don't understand what does it mean, its basically a place where you can write and customize the text in any way. Here is a video for a quick run down for HTML,(Cause i might have not explained it well.)</p>

				<h4>A New Site:</h4>
				<p>Let's first open place where we see our site.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to your Desktop and create a new <b>Folder</b>, you can name it whatever you like.<br><img src="Create a New Folder.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Create a new folder."></li><br>
					<li>Now open the folder and be sure to have the <b>Filename Extensions</b> on.<br><img src="Filename Extensions On1.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Open Appearance."><img src="Filename Extensions On2.png" width="200" height="310" alt="Turn on the Filename Extensions if its off."><br></li><br>
					<li>Create a new <b>NotePad</b>.<br><img src="Create a New NotePad1.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Create a NotePad."><br>Before doing this next part, there is going to be a Warning but you don't have to worry because we know what are we doing.<br>Change its name to <b>"index.html"</b> and click to "Yes" if the warning is there (wich it should be). Be sure to change the <strong>.txt</strong> extension to <strong>.html</strong><br><img src="Create a New NotePad2.png" width="220" height="50" alt="Change the name of the NotePad to index.html"><br>The NotePad should be a search engine (what ever your main search engine is) now.</li>
					<li>Open the <b>index.html</b>. This is your own site in your Computer but... its a bit empty isn't it. If you remember, i told you to use <b>NotePad</b> or <b>NotePad++</b> to write the code. We are going to do that now.<br>Open <b>NotePad</b> or if you have, open <b>NotePad++</b>. Then drag the <b>index.html</b> from the folder to there.<br><img src="Open Console1.png" alt="Open the console the long way"><br>Or you can just right click and click to <b>Open With...</b> and open it with any of the NotePads that way.<br><img src="Open Console2.png" width="500" height="300" alt="Open the console the short way"></li>
