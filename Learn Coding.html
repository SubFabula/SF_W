		<h2>Time to Learn Programming!</h2>
		<p>We'll start with HTML then Lua and go on.</p>
		<p>Before that, if you want to learn Programming from another place, you can use <a href="https://mimo.org/">Mimo</a> which is an app for learning any Programming Language.</p>
		<p>Now! About the place that we are gonna use to Program.<br>So, first you need a Computer (idk any Mobile Apps for Programing), if you don't have a Programming App you can use <strong>NotePad</strong> or download <strong><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">NotePad++</a></strong> wich makes Programming easier.</p>
		<p>Let's learn Programming!</p>

				<h3>HTML</h3>
					<p>Let's first understand what's HTML is actualy used for.</p>
					<p>HTML is made for making Web Sites like this one but its not actualy a Programming Language, its a Mark Up Language or as its name <b>Hiper Text Mark Up Language</b> wich if you don't understand what does it mean, its basically a place where you can write and customize the text in any way. Here is a video for a quick run down for HTML,(Cause i might have not explained it well.)</p>

				<h4>A New Site:</h4>
				<p>Let's first open place where we see our site.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to your Desktop and create a new <b>Folder</b>, you can name it whatever you like.<br><img src="Create a New Folder.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Create a new folder."></li><br>
					<li>Now open the folder and be sure to have the <b>Filename Extensions</b> on.<br><img src="Filename Extensions On1.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Open Appearance."><img src="Filename Extensions On2.png" width="200" height="310" alt="Turn on the Filename Extensions if its off."><br></li><br>
					<li>Create a new <b>NotePad</b>.<br><img src="Create a New NotePad1.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Create a NotePad."><br>Before doing this next part, there is going to be a Warning but you don't have to worry because we know what are we doing.<br>Change its name to <b>"index.html"</b> and click to "Yes" if the warning is there (wich it should be). Be sure to change the <strong>.txt</strong> extension to <strong>.html</strong><br><img src="Create a New NotePad2.png" width="220" height="50" alt="Change the name of the NotePad to index.html."><br>The NotePad should be a search engine (what ever your main search engine is) now.</li><br>
					<li>Open the <b>index.html</b>. This is your own site in your Computer but... its a bit empty isn't it. If you remember, i told you to use <b>NotePad</b> or <b>NotePad++</b> to write the code. We are going to do that now.<br>Open <b>NotePad</b> or if you have, open <b>NotePad++</b>. Then drag the <b>index.html</b> from the folder to there.<br><img src="Open Console1.png" alt="Open the console the long way."><br>Or you can just right click and click to <b>Open With...</b> and open it with any of the NotePads that way.<br><img src="Open Console2.png" width="500" height="300" alt="Open the console the short way."></li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Tag, Element and Attributes:</h4>
				<p>Before we continue we will be learning what's <b>Tag</b>, <b>Element</b> and <b>Attributes</b> are.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>Tag:</h4></li>
						<p><b>Tags</b> are basically the holder of the <b>Element</b> or a door. First the opening tag "<img src="Open Tag1.png" width="20" alt="<">" and then the closing tag "<img src="Close Tag1.png" width="20" alt=">">" or "<img src="Open Tag2.png" width="30" alt="<>">" then "<img src="Close Tag2.png" width="30" alt="</>">".</p>
						<li><h4>Element:</h4></li>
						<p><b>Element</b> is the code or the one that holds the <b>Content</b> of the code.</p>
						<li><h4>Attribute:</h4></li>
						<p><b>Attributes</b> are used to describe the characteristic of the <b>Element</b> in detail.</p>
						<p>Here is an img for a better visual,<br><img src="Tag, Element and Attribute.png" alt="Tag, Element and Attribute visual."></p>
					</ul>
				<h4>Writing:</h4>
				<p>Now its time to fill the site with some content.</p>
				<p>Let's try to write something, shall we?<br><img src="Write in the Console.png" width="1000" alt="Write your first few word into your console."><br>Don't forget to <strong>SAVE</strong> the file so you don't lose the things you wrote ("Ctrl + s" for shortcut) and shows what you have done in the Browser. Also, refresh the Browser to see the Updated self of the file("F5" or "Ctrl + F5" for shortcut).</p>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>Paragraph Tag:</h4></li>
						<p>We have wrote our first words but its a bit too blank, let's add <b>Paragraphs</b>.</p>
						<p>Write "<img src="Start p.png" width="30" alt="<p>">" and write something you want then add "<img src="End p.png" width="40" alt="</p>">" and <strong>SAVE</strong> the file and refresh the page.<br><img src="Use p1.png" width="1000" alt="Write by using Paragraph Tags."><br>You might thing that its the same but write it again.<br><img src="Use p2.png" width="1000" alt="Do the same thing again."><br>As its name (Paragraph), it creates a <b>Paragraph</b>.</p>
						<li><h4>Heading Tag:</h4></li>
						<p>Having <b>Paragraphs</b> tidies up our site a bit but we dont know what's the content of the <b>Paragraph</b>. Let's add a <b>Title</b>.</p>
						<p>Write "<img src="Start h1.png" width="40" alt="<h1>">" and write the title you want then add "<img src="End h1.png" width="50" alt="<h1>">".<br><img src="Use h1.png" width="1000" alt="Write by using Heading Tags"><br>We have title now but i think you realized that therese a "1" in the <b>Heading Tag</b>. We can change that number between 1 and 6 and get different sized <b>Titles</b>.</p>
						<li><h4>There is just to much tags and stuff i dont have time for eveything!</h4></li>
						<p>ıdk if will countie</p>
					</ul>
